    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>What is your website about?</h2>
        <p>
        A complete guide to Bangkok. Includes all the local eateries and unique
        places that foreign travel websites wouldn’t know about. Allowing the
        travelers to travel around Bangkok like a pro.
        </p>
    <h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
        <p>
        The objective of this website is to introduce Bangkok to travelers the way
        a local guide would. I want this website to accommodate those who are
        planning a trip to Bangkok, therefore, I want to include features like
        weather forecast and maps to allow the user to plan to get the most out of
        each location.
        </p>
    <h2>Who is your target audience?</h2>
        <p>
        My target audience are those who are visiting Bangkok and want a local
        glimpse of what Bangkok looks like and mean to us. In other words, those
        who want to see Thailand/BKK through our lens.
        </p>
    <h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2>
        <h3>Home Page</h3>
            <p>
            For the home page we want to include a quick search function, which will
            minimize irrelevant browsing time. Below we want to include a carousel
            which offers monthly/weekly highlights. We also want to include comments
            and reviews from those who have used our platform for planning their
            trips, and maybe insert an official BKK video presentation.
            </p>
        <h3>1st Page: Restaurants</h3>
            <p>
            Recommendation for Restaurants. Including casual dining / Cafe / Tapas /
            Bakery / Homemade restaurants all over Bangkok. Each restaurant will have
            a tag which specify the location, therefore, the user could search based
            on its geographical location.
            </p>
        <h3>2nd Page: Shop</h3>
            <p>
            Places to shop around in Bangkok. Including the biggest / most interesting
            malls all the way to well known shopping streets or areas. Again, the user
            could specify the location and these activities would also come up.
            </p>
        <h3>3rd Page: Go</h3>
            <p>
            This page includes places to go and see. This will include seasonal events
            as well as places that you cannot miss when you are in Thailand. Places
            that are more traditional and mainstream but it’s a must.
            </p>
        <h3>4th Page: Night Life</h3>
            <p>
            This page will include recommendations for your night activities which may
            include drinking, karaoke or clubbing. Since this page is dedicated to
            travelers, I am planning to include bar with international music and
            places that welcome foreigners.
            </p>
        <h3>5th Page: Play/Do</h3>
            <p>
            This page will include all activities that are recommended for foreigners
            who are visiting. For example, the best places to get massages and for
            beauty / health purposes that may be expensive if you do it in other
            countries.
